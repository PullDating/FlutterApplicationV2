# pull

Pull is an open source dating app founded by William Dormer. The purpose is to create an online dating
platform that better aligns the needs of the people with the app. Match.com has developed a near monopoly
in the online dating landscape, and this has lead to manipulation and predatory buisiness tactics. 
With this project I hope to give them a run for their money, and hopefully improve the situation, either
by replacing them, or forcing them to improve to stay competitive. 

Online dating is not a trivial industry. Societies, democracies in particular, rely on having stable
families for the economy to survive. Unpaired young men can be dangerous, as has been shown time and
time again in history. In short, I view this as a necessary act of public service, rather than a business.

## Getting Started

This flutter application depends on the accompanying backend service. This can be found in the 
APIGateway repo within the Pull Dating Org on github. 

## To update models:
run this command:  flutter pub run build_runner build   
it generates the supporting files for the freezed classes.
